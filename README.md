## ‚ú® Overview

Welcome to **BaseApp**, a clean, scalable, and maintainable **Todo List Manager** designed with modern architectural principles:

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**
- **Clean Architecture** inspired by [Ardalis](https://ardalis.com/) & [Jason Taylor](https://jasontaylordev.com/)
- **Onion Architecture** for strict separation of concerns  
- **SOLID principles** for code quality and maintainability

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Our layered architecture is built to maximize flexibility, testability, and separation of concerns:

| Layer          | Responsibility                                  |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **API**        | REST API endpoints, Swagger docs, Controllers  |
| **Application**| Business logic, CQRS (MediatR), AutoMapper, Validation |
| **Domain**     | Core entities, enums, business rules            |
| **Infrastructure** | Data access, repositories, external services |

This approach ensures that:

- Core business logic stays isolated from infrastructure and UI  
- Dependency flow is inward, preventing tight coupling  
- Your codebase is easy to maintain and evolve over time

- **Swagger UI:** Interactive API documentation out-of-the-box
